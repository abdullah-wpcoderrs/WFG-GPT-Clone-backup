help me create a plan that can allow the chat model to genertae document report when a user request for it using natural language prompting.

Also i want uers to be able to use their prompt or response to train the gpt. so it should have like a memory, where it can store and remember prompts or response styles specified by the user, and iit will be useful for all other users of the GPT agent tool.

And i also want a plan that will be implemented for users to upload additional document  from the chat session so it can read and create better response and also store the information in that document as contexts in its GPT agent instruction as context, and can also be useful for other users of the GPT tool.

Only admin or Superadmin can edit the memory and context instruction of a gpt tool, and for admins, it'd be only gpt's they created themselves for the use of their team.

We are not working on the databse for now, we are still using mock datas to et this done on the frontend.

Enhanced GPT Features Implementation Plan
Based on your requirements, I'll create a comprehensive plan for implementing document generation, memory/context learning, and document upload features for your GPT Desk application.

Overview
This plan will implement three key features:

Document report generation via natural language prompting
User prompt/response memory system for training GPT agents
Document upload functionality for context enhancement
Admin/Superadmin controls for memory/context management
Feature 1: Document Report Generation
Implementation Approach
Extend the chat interface to detect document generation requests
Add a document generation indicator in the UI
Implement a report template system using mock data
Create a document preview/download functionality
Key Components
Natural Language Detection
Add keyword detection in chat messages (e.g., "generate report", "create document", "make summary")
Implement a simple NLP parser to identify document requests
Report Generation Service
Create a mock report generator that produces structured documents
Support multiple document formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
Implement templates for different report types
UI Components
Add document generation status indicators
Create a document preview panel
Implement download functionality
Feature 2: Memory/Context Learning System
Implementation Approach
Create a memory storage system using localStorage/sessionStorage for mock implementation
Implement user preference tracking
Add memory management UI for admins
Develop context application logic
Key Components
Memory Storage
User-specific prompt/response patterns
Shared context preferences for each GPT
Admin-controlled memory templates
Learning Algorithm
Track frequently used prompts
Identify response patterns
Apply learned preferences to future interactions
Admin Controls
Memory review dashboard
Context template management
Approval system for memory updates
Feature 3: Document Upload & Context Integration
Implementation Approach
Add file upload capability to chat interface
Implement document parsing (text extraction)
Create context injection system
Develop shared context repository
Key Components
File Upload System
Drag-and-drop upload area
File type validation (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
File preview functionality
Document Processing
Text extraction from uploaded documents
Key information identification
Context summarization
Context Integration
Dynamic context injection into GPT prompts
Shared context repository for each GPT
Context versioning and management
Feature 4: Admin/Superadmin Controls
Implementation Approach
Implement role-based access control
Create memory/context management interfaces
Add approval workflows for changes
Key Components
Role Management
User role identification (user, admin, superadmin)
Permission-based UI elements
Access control for memory/context features
Management Interfaces
Memory review and editing dashboard
Context template management
GPT-specific configuration panels
Approval Workflows
Change request submission
Review and approval process
Change history tracking
Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1: Document Generation (Week 1)
 Implement natural language detection for document requests
 Create mock report generation service
 Add document preview/download UI components
 Test document generation workflow
Phase 2: Memory System (Week 2)
 Implement memory storage using localStorage
 Create learning algorithm for prompt/response tracking
 Develop admin memory management UI
 Test memory application in chat sessions
Phase 3: Document Upload (Week 3)
 Add file upload capability to chat interface
 Implement document parsing and text extraction
 Create context injection system
 Test document-enhanced chat sessions
Phase 4: Admin Controls (Week 4)
 Implement role-based access control
 Create memory/context management interfaces
 Add approval workflows
 Test admin functionalities
Technical Considerations
Frontend Implementation
Use React hooks for state management
Implement localStorage for mock persistence
Create reusable components for UI elements
Ensure responsive design for all features
Mock Data Structure
typescript
// Memory/Context Storage
interface GPTMemory {
  id: string;
  gptId: string;
  userId?: string; // null for shared context
  patterns: PromptPattern[];
  preferences: UserPreference[];
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}

interface PromptPattern {
  prompt: string;
  responseStyle: string;
  frequency: number;
  lastUsed: string;
}

interface UserPreference {
  type: 'formatting' | 'tone' | 'structure' | 'keywords';
  value: string;
  weight: number;
}

// Document Context
interface DocumentContext {
  id: string;
  gptId: string;
  fileName: string;
  content: string;
  summary: string;
  keyPoints: string[];
  uploadedBy: string;
  uploadedAt: string;
}
UI/UX Considerations
Non-intrusive document upload area in chat interface
Clear indicators for document generation status
Intuitive memory management dashboard for admins
Role-specific UI elements that show/hide based on permissions
Security & Privacy Considerations
Since we're using mock data for now, these considerations will be implemented in the UI layer:

Role-based access controls for memory/context editing
User isolation for personal memory patterns
Clear indication of shared vs. personal context
Document content handling (no actual file storage in mock implementation)
Success Metrics
Document Generation:
Users can request documents through natural language
Generated documents match user expectations
Download functionality works correctly
Memory System:
Prompt/response patterns are correctly identified
Learned preferences improve response quality
Admins can effectively manage memory templates
Document Upload:
Users can successfully upload documents
Document content enhances chat responses
Context is properly shared among users
Admin Controls:
Role-based access works correctly
Memory/context management is intuitive
Approval workflows function as expected
This plan provides a comprehensive approach to implementing the requested features while working within the constraints of a mock data frontend implementation. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation for all features.
